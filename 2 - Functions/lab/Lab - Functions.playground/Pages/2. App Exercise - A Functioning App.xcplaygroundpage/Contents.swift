/*:
 Similarly, if you want to regularly provide progress updates to your user, you can put your control flow statements that check on progress into a function. Write a function called `progressUpdate` after the declaration of `goal` below. The function should print "You're off to a good start." if `steps` is less than 10% of `goal`, "You're almost halfway there!" if `steps` is less than half of `goal`, "You're over halfway there!" if `steps` is less than 90% of `goal`, "You're almost there!" if `steps` is less than `goal`, and "You beat your goal!" otherwise. Call the function and observe the printout. Remember, you can convert numbers using the appropriate Int or Double initializer.
